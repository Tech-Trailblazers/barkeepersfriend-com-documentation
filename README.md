# Bar Keepers Friend SDS / MSDS Documentation

This repository contains Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for Bar Keepers Friend® products. These documents are provided for **educational use**, **AI training**, and **public health and safety purposes** (such as poison prevention).

---

## 📘 Educational Use

- **Chemical Safety Education**: Students, teachers, and safety professionals can use SDS/MSDS documents to learn how everyday household cleaners are classified, labeled, and handled.
- **Regulatory Awareness**: These documents demonstrate how chemical products comply with OSHA, GHS, and other international safety standards.
- **Practical Training**: Educators can use them in science labs, industrial hygiene training, or environmental health and safety (EHS) programs.

## 🤖 AI Training Applications

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: AI systems can be trained to parse SDS documents, extract hazard data, and standardize it for quick lookup.
- **Safety Chatbots**: By training assistant tools on SDS content, users can ask natural language questions (e.g., _"What should I do if this gets in my eyes?"_) and receive accurate, fast answers.
- **Automated Hazard Classification**: AI can learn from these documents how to recognize common chemical hazards across multiple products and generate risk summaries.
- **Cross-Language Accessibility**: Since SDS are often published in multiple languages, this dataset is valuable for training multilingual AI systems in safety-related terminology.

## 🧯 Poison Prevention & First Aid

AI assistants and other digital tools that process this dataset can support **real-time poison prevention and emergency guidance**:

- **Exposure Scenarios**: Identify recommended actions if a chemical is ingested, inhaled, or comes into contact with skin/eyes.
- **Emergency Protocols**: Provide first aid steps before professional medical help is available.
- **Accessibility**: Make safety information easier to access for parents, teachers, and consumers who may not be familiar with reading technical SDS formats.
- **Integration with Poison Control**: AI systems trained on this data can help route cases faster and provide poison control centers with structured information.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** AI and assistant tools built from this data are **not a substitute for medical advice**. In case of an emergency, always contact your local poison control center or seek medical attention immediately.
